# Netflix_EDA
In this Project we have imported the CSV file to Jupyter Notebook and done some operations to fetch the data o/p using libraries:
# Numpy : Numerical python for mathematical and some transformations (playimg with numbers)
# Pnadas: Chiefly used for machine learning for dataframes and Series.
# Matplotlibrary : Used for creating high quality visualizations and graphs.
# Seaborn: This used for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics(similar to Matplotlibrary).,
# Steps:
# ETL, changing datatypes, removing null_values or blank values or filling the numerical values with column aggregation of mean, median or mode,
fetching some rows or records, according to the transformation of data by Year, Cast, category_type, duration columns to convert these records into
some visualizations according to the data using the above Libraries and finding the statistical summary and so on.,
